## Description:
---
This node application will allow a user to enter prompt-based questions through the command line to create a customized html and css document that holds information regarding their team. This includes name, email address, phone number, university information, Github usernames, role, and employee ID. This application utilizes modularization (dist, lib and src) and inquirer!
